                  <p class="tab-faq__q">Where can I download my products after I have completed the purchase?</p>
                  <p class="tab-faq__a">Your products are available immediately after you have made the payment. You can
                    download them from your Member's Area. Right after your purchase has been confirmed, the website
                    will transfer you to Member's Area. All you will have to do is login and download the products you

                    days also cover updates that may come in during this time. This includes new questions, updates and

                    again. Instead, you should head to your Member's Area, where there is an option of renewing your
