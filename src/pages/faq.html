                <p class="faq__q bold">6. How do I know that there has been an update?</p>
                <div class="faq__a">
                  <p>There are several ways to tell if there has been an update:</p>
                  <p>
                    - For iPAD and Testing Engine products just start use the product. Updates will be downloaded automatically.<br />
                    - The New Releases section on <a href="/">www.testking.com</a>. You will notice the rapid updates here. Testking makes several updates every day.<br />
                    - Number of Questions can often be matched from your products and the ones that are mentioned on website for a rough match.
                  </p>
                  <p>In general, we recommend that you should always check for any Exam 3-4 days before you schedule the exam.</p>

                <div class="faq__a">
                  <p>The old version is probably cached at your computer. You could remove History from Internet Explorer, restart the computer or clear the local web cache.
