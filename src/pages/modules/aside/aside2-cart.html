        <p class="b-feedbacks__title">My secret to success in A+</p>
        <p class="b-feedbacks__text">"Being a device maintenance specialist, Comptia A+ certification was a need to
          certify my skills of fundamentals of computer technology, installation and configuration of PCs, laptops and
          related hardware, and basic networking. But with time constrains, preparation to be frank, was at its worst
          best. A colleague recommended the study guide from testking. Its concise answers really helped me out, with
          80% questions in the Comptia A+ 220-801 exam just a copy of what I got in the guide. I managed to complete the
          exam in well under stipulated 90 min, with 87 off 90 answered. A great result for me."</p>

        <p class="b-feedbacks__title">Tried it and never regretted</p>
        <p class="b-feedbacks__text">"With an aim to be a MS MCITP enterprise administrator, my first step was the 70-640. With weak basics in topics like Dynamic DNS, NDDNS or the DNS server configuration, I was looking for something which would be easier to memorize rather than understand the basics in details. I used the q&a from testking and it really helped. A score of 821, considering the amount of time I spent is quite satisfying. It was great to see question of real exams being common from the ones in the QnA. I got around 70% similar questions, which helped in my score obviously. Great material"</p>
